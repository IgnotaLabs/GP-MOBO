# Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization with Independent Tanimoto Kernel Gaussian Processes for Diverse Pareto Front Exploration (README.md in construction)

GP-MOBO is a novel multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) algorithm designed to optimize molecular properties using Gaussian Processes (GPs). Leveraging independent Tanimoto kernel GPs for each molecular objective, the model effectively explores the Pareto frontier, balancing exploration and exploitation to identify high-quality, diverse candidate molecules.

**Key Features:**
- **Independent Tanimoto Kernel GPs:** Models each molecular objective separately, capturing the full dimensionality of molecular fingerprints without reducing complexity.
- **Efficient Pareto Front Exploration:** Utilizes the Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI) acquisition function, ensuring superior coverage of the chemical search space. 
- **Scalable & Computationally Efficient:** The model scales well for large datasets and is optimized for multi-objective tasks, making it suitable for drug discovery and molecular design.
